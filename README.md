## About Us
Kind Enterprises is a recreational cannabis cultivation facility that was founded in Boulder, CO.  Our vision is to set a standard for high quality cultivation by adhering to clean practices and using cutting edge technology.  Our goal is to preserve and honor the history of this ancient plant, the culture that pushed to relegalize its use, and to further education and research into the multitude of Cannabis Sativa’s healing cannabinoids.  In doing so, we aim to provide a genetic collection that will include a mix of classics and exciting new breeding projects from our favorite local breeders.  

## Process
Kind Enterprises takes a “hands on” approach, which integrates an experienced gardening team with advanced technology.  We believe that keeping a clean and sterile facility is of upmost importance and take pride in the cleanliness and organization of our grow.  Our facility utilizes cutting edge technology to maintain complete control of our grow room environments.  We finish all of our flowers with a two-week flush to ensure the cleanest taste possible.  All of our cannabis is hand trimmed to preserve the highest quality flowers.
